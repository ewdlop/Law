To **discount your statement to give up your asset**, consider the following **legal defenses and disclaimers**:

### **1. Lack of Legal Intent**  
- If there was no **clear intention** to permanently surrender your asset, your statement may not be legally binding.  
- Example:  
  - "My statement regarding asset relinquishment was made in **hypothetical or informal** circumstances and does not reflect a legally enforceable agreement."

### **2. Coercion or Duress**  
- If you were **pressured, misled, or threatened**, the statement can be **invalidated**.  
- Example:  
  - "I was under undue influence and did not voluntarily agree to relinquish my asset."

### **3. Lack of Consideration (No Exchange of Value)**  
- In many legal systems, a **valid contract** requires something **in return** (consideration).  
- Example:  
  - "No consideration was given in exchange for my asset, making the agreement unenforceable."

### **4. Ambiguity or Vagueness**  
- If the statement was **unclear**, it could be deemed **non-binding**.  
- Example:  
  - "The wording of my statement does not constitute a legally binding declaration of asset forfeiture."

### **5. Revocation or Rescission**  
- If the statement was made but not **legally executed**, you may have the **right to revoke** it.  
- Example:  
  - "I formally rescind any prior statement regarding the relinquishment of my asset."

Would you like me to **incorporate a disclaimer** in your petition to ensure clarity and avoid unintended legal consequences?
