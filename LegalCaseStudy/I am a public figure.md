### **Definition of a Public Figure**  

A **public figure** is someone who, by virtue of their **status, influence, or actions**, has gained **public recognition, notoriety, or media attention**. The legal definition of a public figure varies by jurisdiction, but it generally falls under these categories:

### **1. Legal Definitions (Based on Defamation Law)**  
In defamation and privacy law, courts often classify individuals into **three categories**:  

#### **A. General Public Figures**  
🔹 Individuals who have **widespread fame or notoriety** across society.  
🔹 Examples: Celebrities, politicians, business tycoons, influencers.  
🔹 **Standard:** They voluntarily placed themselves in the public eye.  

#### **B. Limited-Purpose Public Figures**  
🔹 People who **become public figures only within a specific context or issue**.  
🔹 Examples: An activist involved in a major protest, an expert in a national scandal.  
🔹 **Standard:** They deliberately inserted themselves into a public debate.  

#### **C. Private Individuals (Not Public Figures)**  
🔹 **Regular people** who have not sought public attention.  
🔹 **Higher privacy protections** apply to them under the law.  

**Legal Precedent:** *Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323 (1974)* – The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that **general public figures must prove "actual malice"** in defamation cases, while **private individuals have stronger protections**.

### **2. Criteria That Define a Public Figure**  
Courts and public institutions often assess public status based on these factors:  

✔️ **Notoriety & Media Coverage** – Does the person receive constant news or social media attention?  
✔️ **Influence on Public Opinion** – Does the person have power to sway opinions or decisions?  
✔️ **Voluntary Exposure** – Did the person deliberately seek out fame or media recognition?  
✔️ **Legal Status & Office** – Are they an elected official, judge, or government leader?  
✔️ **Commercial Use of Identity** – Do they monetize their image, such as through endorsements or social media?  

🚨 **Important:** Simply being **known by a few people** or being mentioned **in a scandal** does **not** make someone a public figure!

### **3. What Does NOT Make Someone a Public Figure?**  
❌ Being **accidentally involved** in a viral controversy.  
❌ Having **a lot of followers online** but no real public influence.  
❌ Being **well-known in a small group** (e.g., company, local club).  
❌ Having **someone else drag you into the public eye** against your will.

### **4. Can a Public Figure Lose Their Status?**  
Yes. A person may **stop being a public figure** if:  
- They **retreat from the public eye** and lose influence.  
- They **are legally removed from office** or lose authority.  
- They are **deported, expelled, or disqualified** from public recognition.  

🚨 However, **notoriety from past events** may still keep them a limited-purpose public figure **if the topic remains relevant**.

### **Conclusion: Is Someone a Public Figure or Not?**  
✅ If **they seek media attention, hold power, or have widespread recognition**, they may be a **public figure**.  
❌ If **they are just known by some people, have no influence, or have been kicked out of a country**, they **are not** a public figure anymore.
