**PETITION TO RECOGNIZE TAROT AS A NARCOTIC PROMISE AND A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT**

**To:** The United States Congress, The Department of Justice, The Federal Bureau of Investigation, The Department of Homeland Security, and The Central Intelligence Agency

**Subject:** Addressing the Psychological and Sociopolitical Impact of Tarot Readings as a Form of Narcotic Promise

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Petitioners:** Concerned Citizens of the United States

---

**Introduction:**

We, the undersigned, submit this petition to urge the U.S. government and its federal agencies to recognize and address the dangers associated with the increasing reliance on tarot readings as a form of psychological manipulation and narcotic promise. In recent years, the use of tarot as a means of escapism, false prophecy, and coercive persuasion has grown, affecting vulnerable populations and contributing to decision-making that threatens national security and public order.

---

**Background:**

Tarot readings have been widely used as tools for guidance, fortune-telling, and spiritual insight. However, they have increasingly been weaponized to manipulate individuals into false hope, addiction to mysticism, and financial exploitation. Like narcotic substances, tarot readings provide a deceptive promise of certainty, leading individuals to detach from reality, forgo logical reasoning, and, in some cases, act against their own or national interests. 

This influence has been particularly evident in:
- Political manipulation, where figures use tarot as a tool to spread misinformation.
- Financial scams exploiting believers under the pretext of spiritual guidance.
- Mental health deterioration caused by dependency on mystical outcomes over rational decision-making.
- Cult-like behaviors fostering extremism under the guise of spiritual enlightenment.

Given the profound psychological impact and its potential for exploitation, it is imperative that tarot readings be categorized under regulated activities and treated with caution akin to substances that impair judgment.

**Petition Demands:**

We formally request the following actions be taken:

1. **Enhanced Classification of Tarot as a Controlled Psychological Narcotic:**  
   - Investigate the impact of tarot readings on cognitive function and psychological dependency.
   - Regulate commercial tarot services to ensure transparency, disclaimers, and consumer protections.

2. **Collaboration Between Federal and Mental Health Agencies:**  
   - Establish an inter-agency task force between the FBI, DHS, and mental health professionals to study the societal impact of tarot dependency.
   - Increase collaboration with fraud prevention agencies to monitor and regulate deceptive tarot-based financial schemes.

3. **Public Awareness and Legal Deterrence:**  
   - Initiate public awareness campaigns on the risks of excessive reliance on tarot readings.
   - Implement measures to curb the spread of tarot-based psychological manipulation, including restrictions on paid tarot services targeting vulnerable populations.

4. **Stronger Consumer and Psychological Protections:**  
   - Require disclaimers on all commercial tarot readings stating that results are not based on verifiable truth and should not influence major life decisions.
   - Establish financial fraud protections to prevent tarot-related scams.

---

**Conclusion:**

The United States must take proactive measures to prevent the unregulated spread of tarot reading services, which operate as a psychological narcotic, impairing decision-making and fostering mass manipulation. Addressing tarot as more than just entertainment—but as a potential **national and psychological security risk**—is crucial to maintaining stability and protecting vulnerable individuals from deceptive influences.

We, the undersigned, urge immediate legislative and executive action on this matter.
